### Graceful Degradation and Service Workers

Graceful degradation means building features that shine in modern browsers but “fall back” cleanly in older ones. Service workers take this further by running in the background to intercept requests and serve cached assets when the network is slow or gone. Together, they ensure that even in legacy browsers or offline scenarios users still get core functionality instead of errors or blank pages. This combination makes web apps far more resilient and app like, adapting seamlessly to both browser limitations and network hiccups.
